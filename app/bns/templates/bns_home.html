<h2>{% trans "Basic Necessities Survey" %}</h2>

<p>{% trans "The BNS is not based on the assumption that people are doing well if they make more than 1-2 dollars per day, or are in poverty if they make less. Rather, it is based on the understanding that people themselves are best able to decide what constitutes well-being. The approach is based on a United Nations definition of poverty as a lack of basic necessities. More specifically the approach asks communities to define what goods and services are necessary for a family to meet their basic needs. Examples of goods include material items such as: an axe, mobile phone, bed, or cook-stove. Services can include: access to clean drinking within 15 minutes’ walk, reasonable walking distance to health care, children attending school, women participating in community decision making, or absence of domestic violence, etc. Families who do not own or have access to this basket of goods and services are, by community de nition, not meeting a basic, minimum standard of well-being and thus according to the community-defined are poor (i.e., living below the community de ned poverty line)." %}</p>

<p>{% trans "Basic necessities are democratically defined as those items that 50% or more of respondents agree “are basic necessities that everyone should be able to have and nobody should have to go without”. Items are weighted for importance according to the percentage of respondents who say an item is a basic necessity (i.e. between 50% and 100%). Respondents’ well-being indexes are based on the sum of the weightings of the basic necessities they have, as a percentage of the total they could have if they had all basic necessities." %}</p>
