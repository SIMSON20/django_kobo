"The BNS is not based on the assumption that people are doing well if they "
"make more than 1-2 dollars per day, or are in poverty if they make less. "
"Rather, it is based on the understanding that people themselves are best "
"able to decide what constitutes well-being. The approach is based on a "
"United Nations definition of poverty as a lack of basic necessities. More "
"specifically the approach asks communities to define what goods and services "
"are necessary for a family to meet their basic needs. Examples of goods "
"include material items such as: an axe, mobile phone, bed, or cook-stove. "
"Services can include: access to clean drinking within 15 minutes’ walk, "
"reasonable walking distance to health care, children attending school, women "
"participating in community decision making, or absence of domestic violence, "
"etc. Families who do not own or have access to this basket of goods and "
"services are, by community de nition, not meeting a basic, minimum standard "
"of well-being and thus according to the community-defined are poor (i.e., "
"living below the community de ned poverty line)."

"Basic necessities are democratically defined as those items that 50%% or "
"more of respondents agree “are basic necessities that everyone should be "
"able to have and nobody should have to go without”. Items are weighted for "
"importance according to the percentage of respondents who say an item is a "
"basic necessity (i.e. between 50%% and 100%%). Respondents’ well-being "
"indexes are based on the sum of the weightings of the basic necessities they "
"have, as a percentage of the total they could have if they had all basic "
"necessities."
